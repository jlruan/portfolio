I designed and manufactured multiple parts on the Purdue Electric Racing 2025 competition car as well as helping to manufacture the chassis and related test and assembly equipment. 

## What I Did

I designed the harness tabs using NX to optimize harness ergonomics for our primary driver to improve his comfort, directly improving our race times. I also designed the battery mounts as well as several chassis closeouts and body panels and validated that all parts matched rigidity/deformation targets with ANSYS. I also manufactured parts using conventional multi-axis manufacturing methods as well as using composite manufacturing techniques such as wet layups, pre-preg, and resin infusion.
