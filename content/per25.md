I designed the harness tabs using NX to optimize harness ergonomics for our primary driver to improve his comfort and verified that they were structurally sound in case of a collision.

 I also designed the battery mounts as well as several chassis closeouts and body panels and validated that all parts matched rigidity/deformation targets with ANSYS.

 I also manufactured parts using conventional multi-axis manufacturing methods as well as using composite manufacturing techniques such as wet layups, pre-preg, and resin infusion. Here's us assembling the chassis jig which holds the tubes in place for welding.
