I founded Purdue's NASA Lunar Autonomy Challenge team, and we were one of 20 or so teams selected to compete. The goal of the competition was to map a selected area of lunar topography as efficiently as possible using a pre-existing rover type. 

Our approach was to generate a point cloud and then use RANSAC to identify the ground plane, and use the point cloud as well as a Yolov11 detector to match rocks.

We're currently competing so I'll update this page as the competition progresses.
