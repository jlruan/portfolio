I used Onshape and SolidWorks to design the power/communications slip ring assembly as well as parts of the sensor array and module mounting system. I also used Python to develop corroboration functionality to sync timestamps of photos and sensors for VIO SLAM, increasing precision of localization by 22%.

Here's us testing the robot at USDA Ames National Laboratory. (I'm controlling the robot and monitoring the data, I promise I'm not just being lazy!)
