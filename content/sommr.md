I worked on a robot for the USDA and the Collaborative Robotics Lab at Purdue. I then planned and executed a field test at the USDA Ames National Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.

## What I Did

I used Onshape and SolidWorks to design the power/communications slip ring assembly as well as parts of the sensor array and module mounting system. I also used Python to develop corroboration functionality to sync timestamps of photos and sensors for VIO SLAM, increasing precision of localization   by 22%.
