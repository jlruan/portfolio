I founded a FIRST Robotics Competition team senior year while designing and programming a robot that ranked 20th offensively worldwide while competing.

## What I Did

During the 2024 season, I fundraised over $30K for competition and robot costs. I also designed multiple subsystems and gearboxes on our award-winning competition robot, reducing part count by up to 72% in some mechanisms which greatly improved ease of assembly. I also developed localization systems using PhotonVision to detect fiducials and game objectives and utilized it in autonomous routines, improving our localization by 32%. Combined with constraint-based path planning for autonomous, this improved our scoring by up to 25%. To reduce the fiscal burden of vision, I designed custom vision assemblies using commonly available global shutter camera modules reducing vision costs from $400 to $100 per unit.
