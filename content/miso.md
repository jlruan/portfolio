During the 2024 season, I fundraised over $30K for competition and robot costs for my rookie FRC team that ended up ranking as high as #20 offensively.

I also developed localization systems using PhotonVision to detect fiducials and game objectives and utilized it in autonomous routines, improving our localization by 32%. Combined with kinematically-feasible constraint-based path planning for autonomous, this improved our scoring by up to 25%.

I also designed multiple subsystems and gearboxes on our award-winning competition robot, reducing part count by up to 72% in some mechanisms which greatly improved ease of assembly.

To reduce the fiscal burden of vision, I designed custom vision assemblies using commonly available global shutter camera modules reducing vision costs from $400 to $100 per unit.
